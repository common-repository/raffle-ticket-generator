This plugin is used with WooCommerce to generate raffle ticket numbers that are emailed to customers.


== Description ==

The free version of this plugin generates 500 unique raffle ticket numbers and then recycles.  It starts with ticket number 100 and increments each ticket number by 1 until 599.  The 501st ticket will be assigned number 100 again and so on.  This is designed for small raffles.  Upon completing checkout in WooCommerce, the customer is emailed the ticket numbers.

To setup the raffle, simple install the plugin as described below.  Then create a product in WooCommerce and put in the number of raffle tickets for the product.  Example, if you put 5 in the number of tickets field, that product will generate 5 tickets.  

Please use https://wpraffle.com for support.  If you open a support ticket there, you will receive much faster support.  For some reason we are having problems getting alerted to support requests on the repository here at wordpress.org.

It also allows for a prefix and suffix declaration and can define multiple raffles with different ticket numbers in the same cart.   The Silver Version also included the option to generate graphical ticket images from a selection of stock images and includes a pick a winner feature to select a winner for your raffle and embed it in a page or post using shortcodes.

The Gold version includes Archiving, Backup and Restore capabilities, a 50-50 or Split the Pot Raffle Feature, use custom raffle ticket images, and the ability to manage and limit ticket sales for a specific raffle.  The Gold version also has a successive number feature to put refunded tickets back into stock to be reassigned for events such as a ball drop or duck race.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I define a custom raffle ticket number format? =

Not with this version.  The Silver and Gold versions allow that.

= Does this allow me to sell unlimited tickets? =

Yes, although the numbers recycle after the first 500 tickets, so there are only 500 unique numbers.  
The Silver and Gold versions allow unlimited unique ticket numbers.

= Is this a trial version of the paid full feature editions? =

No, this is simple version for small raffles.  This is not a trial of our full featured editions.

= Can I remove the WPRaffle branding from the order emails? =

Not with this version.  The Silver and Gold versions allow that.

== Upgrade notice ==
The previous versions allowed for 100 unique numbers, we have increased that to 500 and have added an export feature

== Screenshots ==

1. This screenshot shows the product configuration in WooCommerce.  When the plugin is installed, the product editor will show a "Number of Raffle Tickets" field.  Leave it blank for normal products without a raffle ticket, if you want it to be a raffle ticket item, then put in the appropriate number.  In this example it is 50 - this product will generate 50 tickets.
